- Padding increases
- Button layouts change from vertical to horizontal stacking

### Medium Screens (md: 768px+)

- Main content margins adjust accordingly

### Large Screens (lg: 1024px+)

## Key Improvements

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: All components now start with mobile layouts and enhance for larger screens
2. **Better Text Handling**: Added truncation and wrapping where appropriate
3. **Improved Touch Targets**: Maintained adequate button sizes for mobile interaction
4. **Smoother Transitions**: Enhanced animation and transition smoothness
5. **Flexible Layouts**: Components now adapt gracefully to different screen sizes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Devices** (320px - 639px):

   - Verify single-column layouts work properly
   - Check button stacking and touch targets
   - Ensure text doesn't overflow

2. **Tablets** (640px - 1023px):

   - Test sidebar functionality and width
   - Verify 2-column grid layouts
   - Check navigation usability

3. **Desktop** (1024px+):
   - Ensure all features work as expected
   - Verify 4-column layouts display correctly
   - Test sidebar and overlay interactions

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx`
2. `src/components/admin/HitAnalyticsWidget.tsx`
3. `src/components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx`

All changes maintain existing functionality while significantly improving the responsive experience across all device sizes.
