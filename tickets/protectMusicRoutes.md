# Ticket: Protect `/music` Route (Admin Only)

## Goal

Restrict access to the `/music` route so that only authenticated admin users can access it. If a non-admin or unauthenticated user tries to access `/music`, they should be redirected to the home page (`/`). The `/music` route should not be visible or accessible from any navigation or menu.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Create an Admin Route Guard

- [ ] Implement a React component (e.g., `AdminRoute`) that checks if the user is authenticated and has admin rights.
- [ ] If the user is not an admin or not authenticated, redirect them to `/`.

### 2. Apply the Guard to the `/music` Route

- [ ] In your main router (e.g., `App.tsx`), wrap the `/music` route with the `AdminRoute` guard.
- [ ] Ensure the `/music` route renders the correct page/component only for admins.

### 3. Hide `/music` from Navigation

- [ ] Confirm that there are no links to `/music` in the navigation bar, mobile menu, or anywhere else in the UI.
- [ ] Double-check that the route is not accessible through any visible UI element.

### 4. Test Access Control

- [ ] As an admin, verify you can access `/music`.
- [ ] As a non-admin or logged-out user, verify you are redirected to `/` if you try to access `/music` directly.

---

## Notes

- Use Jotai atoms (`isAuthenticatedAtom`, `isAdminAtom`) for authentication and admin checks.
- No UI changes are needed in the navigation component for this route.
- This approach ensures `/music` is only accessible to admins, even if someone tries to visit the URL directly.
